# blackjack

This program builds on the Higher Lower program. It follows the same general logic:
create a game that can play itself, add values based on wins and losses, and use that
info to change the gameplay style. In this case, I am using a more complex game in 
blackjack, but one that is still solved so that I can see how the program performs.
Rather than simply choosing based on one card, it must choose based on the dealer card
that is showing as well as the total the player currently has. This explains the much larger
data tables being used.
I do not yet have any capacity for the dual values of aces or betting options like
splitting or doubling down.
